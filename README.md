# Practical C: Programming starter

My journey through learning, experimenting and writing real programs while re-learning the C programming language are captured in this repository. These are all the programs I wrote and tried to experiment different concepts of the language. For folks new to writing production ready C programs, this also serves as the C programming kickstarts with concepts demonstrated and documented in README.

## Preface
Learning by reading huge books is good but unless you create the first program and tinker with different concepts, it is practically not possible to understand a language deep down. **Don't Think** and **clone this repo*** if you are like me and like to learn by **writing real code**. These gives you starter programs that demonstrate various concepts but at the same time provide you a quick start scaffold that you can touch, feel, modify and experiment.

Chapters and the configuration of this project can also serve you dual purpose by providing a kick start repo for writing real production code.
